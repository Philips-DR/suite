"""How a book's chapters and title are found when it is not laid out like a paper.

Shaped on a real ebook (Dreams and Visions, 2026-10-30), with made-up text: Docling read its contents page as
headings, each followed by a line about the chapter, so every entry became a chapter of one sentence and the
whole book went into the last of them ("Introduction", 4 h 09 min). Its own chapters were "Chapter 3" on a line
of its own, which Docling read as text and put at the foot of the chapter's first page, sometimes with no title
heading at all. Its PDF named no title, so the first heading on its first page ("Praise for") became the title.
