"""audiobook's second front door: the same operations the CLI runs, reachable by a model.

Both doors sit directly on operations.py; neither wraps the other. Long work -- Docling reading
a book, a render, cloning a voice -- starts as a background job and returns at once with an id;
`job_status` is how anyone, a model or the suite's web app, watches it.

Where jobs are kept is injected (AUDIOBOOK_JOBS), like the paths in the other tools' doors. The
tool's own data (output/, voices/, .cache/) is relative to the folder it runs from, and ./mcp
runs it from there.
