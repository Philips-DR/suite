"""Analysing, rendering and cloning as background jobs.

A render of a whole book is hours of CPU, Docling's first look at a long one is minutes, and
cloning a voice searches a recording for its best 30 seconds; no request/response protocol
stays open that long. A job returns at once with an id; the work
runs as a detached `python -m audiobook ...` process; `refresh` reads its progress back from
its log. Nothing blocks, so nothing needs a cap.

Detached on purpose: the process belongs to nobody, so restarting whatever started it (the
assistant, or the MCP door) does not kill it. And if it does die -- the machine sleeps, a
reboot -- starting the same render again loses nothing, because every spoken chunk is cached
(CLAUDE.md, render.py): the job picks up where the cache ends.

Same shape as meet-ai's transcription jobs, deliberately, but not shared with them: no tool
imports another. State is a JSON file and a log per job; a pid is checked against /proc before
anyone believes it, since a pid left over from before a reboot can belong to anything.
