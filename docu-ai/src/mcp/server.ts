/**
 * docu-ai's second front door: the same operations the CLI exposes, reachable by a model.
 *
 * Both doors sit directly on `operations.ts`; neither wraps the other. A model calling `build` and
 * a person typing `npm start -- build` run identical code and differ only in how the result is
 * formatted — JSON here, prose there.
 *
 * `zod` is a direct dependency on purpose, pinned to the range the MCP SDK itself resolves so npm
 * dedupes to ONE copy. This is the same hazard CLAUDE.md records for google-auth-library: two
 * copies of a schema library yield two nominally distinct types, and `registerTool` then rejects
 * a schema built with the wrong one. Check `npm ls zod` shows a single deduped entry before
 * bumping either package.
