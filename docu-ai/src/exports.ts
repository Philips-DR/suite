/**
 * Saving an export as a file, for another tool to take it from (2026-10-30).
 *
 * A file cannot travel through a model. A Word CV is ~650 KB, which is at least 217,000 tokens as base64, and one
 * model reply holds 16,000: the model would have to copy the bytes into its next call, and cannot. So the suite
 * gives docu-ai one folder (`DOCU_AI_EXPORTS`), this writes the file there and hands back only its path, and
 * mail-ai, given the same folder, attaches from it. The folder is injected; docu-ai never chooses or finds one.
