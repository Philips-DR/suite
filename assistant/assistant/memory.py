"""What the assistant knows about you, and the only genuinely stateful thing in the suite.

Two stores behind one interface: a small, human-editable JSON file (what the tests and a bare checkout
use) and a PostgreSQL table (what the containers use, chosen by DATABASE_URL). Retrieval is still not a
vector store. Only once there is more than fits in a prompt does it earn its infrastructure; at personal
scale, every fact goes in the system prompt and the model sees all of it, which is both simpler and
strictly more accurate than top-k similarity. `relevant()` is the seam: swapping retrieval in is a change
there and nowhere else.

Tools never read this. The assistant passes down whatever a tool needs as an argument,
which is what keeps every tool stateless with respect to your life.
