"""What meet-ai can be asked to do, as data in and data out.

Both front doors sit on this: ./transcribe and ./notes format these results for a person,
mcp_server.py returns them as JSON to a model. Neither door wraps the other -- a door that
delegates to the other inherits its output format, its exit codes and its assumptions about
who is reading, and the two drift the moment either is changed for its own audience.

Nothing here writes to stdout. transcribe.py predates this module and prints its progress
as it goes, so the one operation that calls into it redirects that away: for the MCP door
stdout IS the protocol stream, and a stray line of progress corrupts it. The information is
in the returned value either way.
