"""One safe GET or HEAD. Every rule from safety.py is applied here, to every request and every redirect.

What it does, and what it never does:

  * GET and HEAD only. No request body, no cookies kept or sent, no login, no proxy (`trust_env=False`
    ignores HTTP_PROXY and ~/.netrc: a proxy would resolve names itself and skip the check).
  * The host is resolved and vetted, then the connection goes to that address -- the URL handed to the HTTP
    client has the address in it, with the real name kept for the `Host` header, for TLS's server name and
    for certificate checking. The name is never resolved a second time.
  * Redirects are followed by hand, up to five, and each one is checked from the start: a public page that
    redirects to http://169.254.169.254/ is refused at that hop.
  * A body larger than 5 MB is cut there, counting what it is *after* decompression, so a few kilobytes of
    gzip cannot become a gigabyte. A request is given 30 s to answer and 60 s in all.
