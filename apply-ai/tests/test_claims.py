# Philip Baah Afriyie

Accra, Ghana — open to remote

## Experience

### Machine Learning Engineer — Ayadata GH

- **Computer vision for agriculture.** Engineered object detection models on drone imagery for automated crop counting, reaching 91.8% precision on banana trees with MMDetection and 94% precision on palm trees with Ultralytics YOLOv8, to improve harvest planning.
- **Real-time voice AI survey platform (prototype, not deployed to production).** Designed an unattended IVR system that conducts spoken telephone surveys in a local Ghanaian language.
- Built agentic RAG systems on LangChain and LangGraph, with Kafka producers and consumers for high-throughput event processing; our cloud engineer provisions and operates the underlying clusters.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, SQL, Bash
- **Tools:** Git and GitHub, Docker, QGIS
- **Infrastructure:** Kafka, Redis (application/producer-consumer layer), nginx, Ansible (IaC authoring)

## Education

### BSc. Information Technology — BlueCrest University College

Accra, Ghana · CGPA 3.63
