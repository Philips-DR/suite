"""apply-ai's MCP front door: the same operations the CLI exposes, reachable by a model.

Both doors sit directly on operations.py; neither wraps the other. Every tool here only reads, so every
tool is annotated read-only and nothing on this door can be held at an approval gate -- there is nothing
for one to gate. Writing the draft is the assistant's own gated tool, and these are what a model runs
first, so that what a person is asked to approve has already been through them.

Source files are read from disk by this tool, never passed in as text: a model retyping a CV could let a
paraphrase stand in for the source, and then the check would be against the paraphrase. They are confined
to the folders in APPLY_AI_ROOTS (tools.yaml injects the uploads folder).
